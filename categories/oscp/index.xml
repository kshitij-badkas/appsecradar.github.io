      <description>Introduction: Unboxing SolidState; a fun box by creator ch33zplz - This wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first box on HTB but still I&amp;rsquo;ll start my blog series with this. You will come to know why I am giving such an honour to this box. Just stay with me till the end. I thoroughly enjoyed solving this box &amp;amp; the &amp;lsquo;State&amp;rsquo; of satisfaction after getting root was totally something else! I promise, by the end, it will be a &amp;lsquo;Solid&amp;rsquo; stroll down your memory lane!</description>
